Provides a CKEditor integration for your Symfony2 Project. This bundle ads the form field type ``ckeditor``Â to the Form Component.

This is now only a fork of IvoryCKEditorBundle, please use rather that bundle. 
I will extend this in a future as I will need to add filebrowser and ability other bundles to add extra plugins and toolbars to CKEditor instances.
